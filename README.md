### App
The purpose of this app is to consolidate all Dungeons and Dragons campaigns into one place so that a player can keep track of all the campaigns they might be part of. The player has a separate character for each of the campaigns. A dungeon master is able to create their own campaign, and in the future, upload their own maps and NPCs. Currently, it is very barebones with no stylized UIs for most of the components.

It is developed with ReactJS, and will be adding Redux once the scope of the project becomes bigger.

### Features to be implemented
- Character Creation
- Character Buff/Debuff Status
- Character Editing
- Skills and Items database
- User-created database of lore items and skills
- Campaign Editing
- NPC Creation
- Ability to upload a map
- Ability to upload a character portrait
- Allowing Dungeon Masters to edit a character's stats and abilities
- Real-time Updates
- Combat

### Testing
Run `npm start` to run the app for testing. It will reload each time a Javascript file is saved so you can see it almost real-time.
